        <p>Preparing for retirement can be a daunting task. You could get different answers to <span>retirement planning questions</span> from every  source. So, narrowing your scope to a few specific tasks can streamline the retirement planning process. Luckily, there are five basic steps you can take to help <span> secure your retirement plan.</span></p>

        <h2>1. Determine When You Plan to Retire</h2>
        <p>When can you retire? This is a very personal question and depends heavily on your situation. The retirement age is generally considered 65 but Social Security benefits, employment, and family situations can cause the age of retirement to vary greatly from person to person.</p>
        <p>People delay retirement for a variety of different reasons, such as enjoying their job, needing income to support family, and taking time to build more savings. However, as you get closer to retirement, there are a few key ages to keep in mind: <br><br>

<b>Age 55:</b> The earliest that you can draw on retirement plans <span>if you have been separated from your job.</span> <br><br>
<b>Age 59 ½:</b> The earliest that you can begin to withdraw from <span>most retirement plans.</span><br><br>
<b>Age 62:</b> The earliest that you can <span>begin receiving Social Security.</span><br><br>
<b>Age 65: </b>The age that you will become <span>eligible for Medicare coverage.</span><br><br>
<b>Age 66-67: </b>Full retirement <span>age for Social Security.</span><br><br>
<b>Age 70:</b> The latest that you can begin taking <span>Social Security payments.</span><br><br>
<b>Age 72:</b> The age you must begin taking required minimum distributions from most retirement plans.<br><br>
To determine the optimal age for your planned retirement, be sure to work <span>with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™.</span> An experienced financial planner can help you determine the optimal time to retire based on your specific situation.</p>
