            <div class="answer">
                <p>A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a method of investing a fixed amount in a mutual fund scheme at regular intervals. It allows investors to purchase units of a mutual fund scheme at various market levels, providing the benefit of rupee cost averaging and discipline in investing.</p>

                <h2>How does SIP work?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>SIP works by allowing you to invest a predetermined amount in a mutual fund at regular intervals, such as monthly or quarterly. Each time you invest, you receive a certain number of units based on the fundâ€™s Net Asset Value (NAV) on that day.</p>
